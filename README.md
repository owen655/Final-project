## Summary of Findings


**variations studied**

1) Initial Velocity

|Low|Nominal|High|
|---|---|---|
|2.0 m/s|3.55 m/s|7.5 m/s|

2) Initial Flight Path Angle
   
|Low|Nominal|High|
|---|---|---|
|-0.5 rad|-0.18 rad|0.4 rad|

In this study the Initial Velocity and Initial Flight path angles were changed and the trajectories were ploted.
